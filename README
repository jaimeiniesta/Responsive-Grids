A simple HTML5 template prepared for responsive design and using Grids and Baseline/s
Still under developement. 

Dependencies: hashgrid.com (which uses jquery)

USE:
- CMD+G to activate Grid columns visibility
- J to switch between grids 

TO-DO:
- fix visibility of last column of each design. 
I changed the usage of hashgrid from border based visualization to borderless and setting a background. That might cause the last column invisibility. 
- Different baselines for each design
- 
-
